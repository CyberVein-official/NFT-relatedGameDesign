#`NFT`

# Introduction:

NFT is a technology and transaction solution for CROSS to realize the value of big data. All NFTs issued by CROSS are voted by the community and governed together to ensure that the value of data is supported and investor-related income (50%-200% liquid asset income) is achieved. The high degree of freedom of decentralization guarantees 95% the big data business is not affected by the price of Bitcoin.


# Background:

CyberVein uses NFT as a new and huge financial asset category to transfer [digital asset ownership] to the blockchain through NFT, then transfer digital content (such as big data, information materials, etc.) from the blockchain to the secondary market. Then, the huge liquidity value is released. We need more data to be activated, and big data is confirmed through NFT to maximize its value.



# Development direction:
Based on the CROSS platform , the issuance and transaction mechanism of NFT  should be updated. The design of NFT products with practical value and practical significance should be achieved. And with the help of technologies such as electronic signatures and certificates, the authenticity and validity of digital artworks and big data derivatives are proven to realize the traceability and data management of the NFT categories
