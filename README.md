Introduction: NFT is a technology and transaction solution for CROSS to realize the value of big data. All NFTs issued by CROSS are voted by the community and governed together to ensure that the value of data is supported and investor-related income (50%-200% liquid asset income) is achieved. The high degree of freedom of decentralization guarantees 95% Big data business is not affected by the price of Bitcoin.



Background: CyberVein uses NFT as a brand-new and huge financial asset category to transfer [digital asset ownership] to the blockchain through NFT, and then transfer digital content (such as big data, information materials, etc.) from the block The transfer of the chain to the secondary market will release huge liquidity value. At present, more than 20 ZB data has been realized by CROSS through NFT to realize big data monetization, but big data is increasing daily. 20ZB data is only the tip of the iceberg. We need more data to be activated, and big data is confirmed through NFT. Maximize its value.


Development direction: Based on the perfect NFT issuance and transaction mechanism of the CROSS platform, design more NFT products with practical value and practical significance. And insert electronic signatures, certificates and other technologies to prove the authenticity and practicality of digital artworks and big data derivatives, and realize the traceability and data management of NFT categories.
